### In this project

-Clean Architecture
    o Commencing development on Repo Viewer, a sophisticated GitHub client
      app.
    o In-depth exploration of best practices for architecting intricate apps.
    o Initiating, covering essential aspects beyond initial expectations.
-OAuth2 Authentication Implementation
    o implementing OAuth2 protocol for remote server authentication.
    o Development of a robust solution for seamless sign-in to Flutter apps.
    o Ensuring secure token persistence to eliminate the need for frequent user
      sign-ins.
-Paginated Data Local Cashing and UI Integration
    o Acquiring paginated data from the server
    o Implementing local caching.
    o Displaying starred GitHub repositories of signed-in users in the app's user
      interface.
    o Creation of remote and local services for managing paginated data,
      repositories, and application layer classes.
-Code Duplication Removal and Search Functionality
    o Application of techniques to efficiently remove duplicated code from the
      codebase.
    o Abstractions without compromising the existing code.
    o Integration of a user-friendly search functionality into the Repo Viewer app
      for GitHub repository searches.
-WebView Integration and Data Consolidation
    o Incorporation of WebView to display classic HTML content, focusing on the
      README file of GitHub repositories.
    o proper usage of WebView and addressing prerequisites for HTML content
      rendering.
    o Consolidating data from multiple requests to enhance overall app
      performance.
-Internationalization (i18n) and Platform-specific Plugin Development
      o Support Multiple Languages
        ▪ Enable the app to be presented in different languages, allowing users
          to choose their preferred language.
      o Adapt to Cultural Differences
        ▪ Consider cultural nuances in date formats, number systems, and
          other aspects to create a more inclusive user experience.
      o Facilitate Localization
        ▪ Use tools and processes that make it easy to adapt the app's content
          and user interface to specific languages and regions.
      o Emphasis on the necessity of app internationalization (i18n) in the global
        market.
      o Implementation of multi-language support (Localization).
      o Mastery of platform-specific functionality through the creation of plugins for
        Android, iOS, and web platforms using Dart codebase.
